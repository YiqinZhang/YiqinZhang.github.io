                I am pursuing a Computer Engineering degree at Boston University,
                on track to graduate this fall to become a full-stack software developer.
                I originally came from China. Before starting my graduate studies at BU,
                I earned a Master's degree in Landscape Architecture and worked as an urban designer and project manager.

                <p class="text-right">

                    As a software developer, I spend most of my days indoors, but I love to be outside whenever I get the chance.
                    You can find me swimming laps in the pool, hiking through the wilderness, or kayaking down a river.
                    I especially love exploring the beautiful national parks across the US, and I'm always looking for my next adventure.
                    I love to travel a lot, and my all-time favorite city to travel to is Barcelona. The architecture, culture, and food are absolutely incredible.
                    It's hard not to fall in love with the city's unique charm.

            <div class="hobby">
                <p class="text-left">
                    When I'm not out and about, I enjoy curling up on the couch and watching my favorite sci-fi and mystery thriller movies and TV shows.
                    I'm also a big fan of sitcoms and stand-up talk shows, Sometimes, when I'm feeling burned out from staring at a screen all day,
                    I'll shut off all electronic devices and immerse myself in Lego building or jigsaw puzzles.

                    But did you know that I'm also an aspiring chef? That's right, I love experimenting with new recipes and trying out different cuisines.
                    It's a shame that my horticulture skills don't quite match up to my cooking skills, though.
                    Back in college, I majored in landscape architecture, but my green thumb isn't quite there yet.
                    I hate to admit it, but the plants under my care usually don't survive for more than three months. Oops!
